# 1. Code Commit
Whenever developers commit code to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab), the commit triggers a webhook, which sends a notification to Jenkins to start the build and deployment pipeline.

## Webhook Configuration:
- In GitHub, configure a webhook to notify Jenkins of new commits.
- Jenkins is set up to trigger a job when the webhook is received.


# 2. Build & Test (Jenkins)
When the webhook triggers the Jenkins job, Jenkins fetches the latest code from the Git repository, runs automated tests, and builds the application.

Jenkins Pipeline Script (Jenkinsfile):
- This is a sample Jenkins pipeline for building and testing a Node.js application.

```sh
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        REPO_URL = 'https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git'
        BRANCH_NAME = 'main'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git branch: "$BRANCH_NAME", url: "$REPO_URL"
            }
        }

        stage('Install Dependencies') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh 'npm install'  // For Node.js apps, adjust as needed for other languages
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Run Tests') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh 'npm test'  // Running unit tests for the application
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh 'npm run build'  // Build your project
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            cleanWs()  // Clean workspace after build
        }

        success {
            echo 'Build was successful'
        }

        failure {
            echo 'Build failed'
        }
    }
}

```

# 3. Deploy to Staging
After the build and tests are successful, the application is deployed to the staging environment. This can be done using Docker containers or cloud services like AWS ECS, Kubernetes, etc.

## 3.1 Docker Deployment (Staging)
This script will automate the deployment of a Docker container to a staging server.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Set variables
IMAGE_NAME="yourdockerimage"
STAGING_SERVER="your_staging_server_ip"
DOCKER_COMPOSE_PATH="/path/to/docker-compose.yml"  # Update as necessary

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME .

# Stop the running container (if exists)
docker stop $IMAGE_NAME
docker rm $IMAGE_NAME

# Run the new container in the staging environment
docker run -d --name $IMAGE_NAME $IMAGE_NAME

# Optionally, if using Docker Compose:
# ssh $STAGING_SERVER "cd $DOCKER_COMPOSE_PATH && docker-compose up -d --build"

echo "Staging environment updated successfully."

```

# 4. Production Deployment
Once the application is tested in the staging environment, it can be deployed to production. We will use the same method (Docker or cloud services) to deploy the application in production.

## 4.1 Docker Deployment (Production)
The deployment script can be the same as the one for staging, but the target environment will be production.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Set variables
IMAGE_NAME="yourdockerimage"
PROD_SERVER="your_prod_server_ip"
DOCKER_COMPOSE_PATH="/path/to/docker-compose.yml"  # Update as necessary

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME .

# Stop and remove old containers
docker stop $IMAGE_NAME
docker rm $IMAGE_NAME

# Run the new container in production
docker run -d --name $IMAGE_NAME $IMAGE_NAME

# Optionally, if using Docker Compose:
# ssh $PROD_SERVER "cd $DOCKER_COMPOSE_PATH && docker-compose up -d --build"

echo "Production deployment completed successfully."

```
## 4.2 AWS ECS Deployment (Production)
If using AWS ECS for container orchestration:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Set variables
CLUSTER_NAME="your-cluster-name"
SERVICE_NAME="your-service-name"
AWS_REGION="us-east-1"  # Update with your region
IMAGE_URI="your-docker-repo-uri/your-image"  # Update with your ECR image URI

# Authenticate Docker to AWS ECR
aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com

# Tag the image and push to ECR
docker tag $IMAGE_NAME:latest $IMAGE_URI
docker push $IMAGE_URI

# Update ECS service to use the new image
aws ecs update-service --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME --service $SERVICE_NAME --force-new-deployment --region $AWS_REGION

echo "Production deployment to ECS completed."

```

# 5. Monitoring & Notifications
Once the deployment process is complete, it's important to monitor the health of the application. You can set up CloudWatch metrics, Prometheus, or other monitoring tools to track the application's performance.

## Example: Sending notifications through Slack after deployment:
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Send a notification to Slack about deployment success
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url"

curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
--data "{
    \"text\": \"Deployment successful to production environment!\"
}" $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL

```


This repository contains a set of shell scripts and Jenkins pipeline scripts that automate the entire software delivery pipeline from code commit to production deployment.

## Pipeline Overview:
1. **Code Commit**: The pipeline is triggered automatically whenever code is committed to the Git repository (using webhooks).
2. **Build & Test**: Jenkins pulls the latest code, installs dependencies, runs tests, and builds the application.
3. **Deploy to Staging**: After successful build and tests, the application is deployed to the staging environment using Docker or other container orchestration tools.
4. **Deploy to Production**: Once the staging deployment is validated, the application is deployed to the production environment.
5. **Monitoring & Notifications**: After deployment, the application is monitored, and notifications are sent about the success or failure of the deployment.

## Prerequisites:
- **Jenkins**: A Jenkins instance with a properly configured pipeline.
- **Git Repository**: A Git repository for version control.
- **Docker**: Docker installed for containerization (if used).
- **Cloud Environment**: AWS, Kubernetes, or other cloud platforms for deployment.
- **Slack**: For deployment notifications (optional).

## How to Use:

1. **Jenkinsfile**:
   - Place the `Jenkinsfile` in your repository.
   - Configure your Jenkins instance to use this file to automate the build and test process.

2. **Deployment Scripts**:
   - Use the provided Docker deployment scripts to automate the deployment to staging and production.
   - Modify the script variables to match your environment (e.g., server IP, Docker image name, AWS region, etc.).

3. **Monitoring & Notifications**:
   - Set up monitoring (e.g., AWS CloudWatch) to track the health of your deployed application.
   - Configure Slack or any other notification service to alert you on deployment success or failure.

## Example Usage:
1. **Push code to Git**: A commit to the Git repository triggers the Jenkins pipeline.
2. **Build & Test**: Jenkins fetches the latest code, installs dependencies, and runs tests.
3. **Deploy to Staging**: The application is deployed to a staging environment.
4. **Deploy to Production**: After successful testing in staging, the application is deployed to production.
5. **Notification**: A notification is sent to Slack about the deployment status.

# How to Generate GitHub API Access Tokens ?

## What is GitHub API Access Token ?

- GitHub API access tokens are authentication credentials that allow you to interact with GitHub's API on behalf of a user or an application. These tokens provide a way to authenticate your requests when you're using the GitHub API programmatically.

- When you make requests to the GitHub API, you need to include an access token in the request headers for authentication. This token identifies who you are and what permissions you have. GitHub API access tokens can have different scopes, which determine the level of access they grant. For example, a token might have read-only access to public repositories, or it might have full access to all repositories.
